Javascript for edx boot camp challenge


I had been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

My task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

    The total number of months included in the dataset.

    The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

    The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

    You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.

        (Total/(Number of months - 1))

    The greatest increase in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

    The greatest decrease in losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

When opened in the browser the code looks like this:

I didn't make any commits on this assignment as It was kept locally on my machine, I aspire to do so more so in the future in the event of catastrophic data loss. From this challenge I learned about the Push function, iterating through nested arrays, the toFixed function, and that I need to account for zero indexing. Also, that AI is a patient teacher, I used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help guide me in iterating through arrays initially. 

I bought two books for this assignment that helped: JavaScript in Easy Steps by Mike McGrath. and Javascript for Dummies 7-in-1 2023 edition by Chris Minnick. I also found out about two interesting extensions, one that can analyze your code and spot errors, and one that refactors the code to not look like a pig's ear. These were codiumAI, and Prettier.
